        <p>Please review the following choices and pick your favorite message from each group, once you have picked a choice for all of them the results will be revealed along with which agent each message belongs to. Above each group of options is a description of the test case, also generated by an agent.</p>

            <div class="agent-explanation">
                <h3>Original Agent</h3>
                <p>This is the agent we currently have in use.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="agent-explanation">
                <h3>Second Agent (Natural language)</h3>
                <p>We have a two step process, using two agents, first we convert the result into natural language (you can see the results of that as the test case description), then we have a second agent with very similar instructions to what we currently have crafting the results.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="agent-explanation">
                <h3>Third Agent (Multi-step)</h3>
                <p>This agent is asked to provide four options:</p>
                    <p>"Please craft four options for me of a push title and push body, explain why you think this will garner the most interest and also, the biggest reason the language you chose is not an enticing message for users."</p>
                <p>Then once it returns results, we ask it to pick the best one and return in json format</p>
            </div>
            <div class="agent-explanation">
                <h3>Context Altered Original</h3>
                <p>
                    This is almost the same as the first agent, this agent is actually taking in different data that platform could be passing, this time every json key has a value and a context, the context is an string natural language explanation of what the key respresents.
                    The concept here would be to annotate every key with a natural language explanation in platform to allow the agent to have the best understanding of what the data was.
